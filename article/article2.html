            <p>
                This article examines the economic theory governing the PPP projects with reference to the Indian experience. Though this country has been chosen as the case study, the concepts introduced and discussed in this article can be applied to any PPP project in any developing country. The key themes in this article are that the evaluation, financing, allocation, and execution of PPP projects must be done based on sound economic principles and not on the basis of political considerations.
